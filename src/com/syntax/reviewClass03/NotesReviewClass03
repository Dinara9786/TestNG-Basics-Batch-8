ASSERTIONS in TestNG:

Hard Assertion = > if fails then the entire execution will stop. We use assert class.

Soft Assertion = > SoftAssert class; it collects errors during the test adn does not throw exception until we call
method .assertAll();
if assertion fails, it will continue execution.

testng xml = serves configuration file. It configuration file for our testng project.
We can contol our entire execution.
Configuration file in testNG, with help of whihc we can define which testmethods, classes,
packages we want to execute.

Groups:
to implement:
we can group our test cases.
smoke case is when to verify that the environment is there and important functionality is working.

1. @Test(group = "smoke"/"login"/"sprint1");
2. will specify <groups> in testng xml file

BeforeMethod vs BeforeTest:

BeforeMethod: The annotated method will be run before each test method.
BeforeTest: The annotated method will be run before any test depends on xml file <test> tag is run.

Another feature in TestNG is DATAPROVIDER

DataProvider in TestNG is a feature that allows to perfomr DDT (data driven testing)
DataProvider is a method taht will return us an object of 2Dimensional Array

How to implement it:
1.
