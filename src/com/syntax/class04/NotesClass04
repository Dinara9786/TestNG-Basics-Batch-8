DataProvider - allow to perform DDT (data driver testing)
    testing same functionality with different sets of data.
    data and code are independent.
    If we make any changes in the data, our code in test does not get affected.

Groups in TestNG:
we can group our testing ie: we can group based on functionality (like payment, search etc)
we can test as a group with help of groups = "regression"

groups in TestNG = allow to group test cases:
based on type of testing (smoke, regression, database etc)
based on the functionality( login, search, payment etc)
or based on sprints (sprint 1, sprint 5 etc)

1. @DataProvider is a  method that will return 2 dimensional array.
2. identify which test method will be suing it @Test (dataProvider = "name")



Listeners: it is features that listens to or keeps track any event that happens during test execution:
                test starts
                test pass
                test fail
                test skipped
                test finished

It allows to add additional behaviors.

It modifies default testng behaviours.
Many listeners are available in TestNG.

How to implement:

1. Create a listener class that will implement ITestListener interface
2. Provide implementation to the methods you want
3. Create xml file

What is data driven testing = when we perform execution. We pass different testing parameters.
