TestNG Class 2, December 23, 2020

TestNG is annotation based tools.frameworks

@Test = is a main annotation adn it marks our method as Test method.

TestNG has annotation for pre-condition, that is defined with @Before(method, class).
TestNG has annotation for post-condition, that is defined with @After(method, class).

US 17667: Error Message "Invalid Credentials"

TestNG Parameters:
- priority
    priority = 0 --> is set by default
    priority = 1 --> we are defining a priority of the test

- enabled = if false = this test will be skipped and will not be executed. will skip the execution
when we report a bug we create a jira ticket = steops to reproduced, description of bug, priority, severity.
Before enything we should re-test.

    enabled = true - is a default behaviour
    enabled = false -- > if we want to skip specific test

When exception is thrown , first of all execution will be stopped and TestNG will mark as test failed.

US876876: Error message "Invalid credentials" shoudl be displayed when user enters invalid credentials

ASSERTIONS in TESTNG (validation)

we use Assert Class
    Assert.assertTrue();
    Assert.assertEquals();

    Assert is basically our exception. Error message will be thrown.

    Any time the assertion fails, the codes will stop.
    we use assertion in validation, and do not use if else condition

2 types of assertion

- hard assertion is useful if we have 1 validation. And if it fails, the whole execution stops.
assert.equals = we compare strings
assert.true = boolean = isDisplayed, or isEnabled etc we can put custom message as well, which will be
printed in the console if test will fail.

- soft assertion = > will perform the validation, it will collect if assertions failed, but not stops running.
This assertion is useful if we have multiple validation.
at the end we need to call method .assertAll();

In testing we should try to develop cases that run independently. Depends on the company.

Another feature in TestNG = > is Batch Execution when multiple tests are executed together => XML file =
testng.xml file.

actual message = what we get
expected message = when we see in the website

 Assert.assertEquals(invalidCredentialsText, expectedErrorText, "Not correct message is displayed. ");
 if test fails , the custom message will be displayed ("Not correct message is displayed").
 If test passes, no message will be displayed.

FOR VALIDATION WE SHOULD USE ASSERTION

TestNG Parameters:

- priority
    priority = 0; is set by default
    priority = 1; we are defining a priority of the test

- enabled
    enabled = true; is a default behaviour
    enabled = false; if we want to skip specific test

- dependsON
    we can create Test methods that will depend on others.
    In case of failure depended method will be skipped/ignored from the execution

BATCH EXECUTION:

xml file serves as configuration to execute TEstNG tests

how to format:

on Mac: option+command+L
on Windows ctrl+alt+L
