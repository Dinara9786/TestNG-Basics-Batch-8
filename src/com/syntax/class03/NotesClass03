Class 03 TestNG, December 26, 2020

xml file is a configuration file where we can specify which classes, emthods adn group to run. ,  we perform any configuration what we would like to run.
And we can do batch execution with xml file.

Structure:
It is based on tags:

<suite name = "Any Name" >
    <test name = "Any Name">
        <packages>
            <classes>
                <class name = "com.syntax.class2.HW">
                    <methods>
                        <exclude name = "logoValidation/>" // this method will be excluded from execution
                    </methods>
                </class>
            </classes>
        </packages>
    </test>
</suite>
----------------------------------

Assertions

2 types = hard and soft

Assertiosn are our validation points.
Hard => if assertion fails, then the execution will stop right away. It comes from Assert Class
Soft => collects all the failures and then at the end we need to call method => .assertAll().
It comes from SoftAssert and we need to create Object.

@Test(dependsOnMethods=" which method")

@Test(dependsOnMethods="turnOn")
public void turnOff(){
...................
}

@Test
public void turnOn(){
...................
}

why we use enabled: to skip
enable = false = > means do not run

if enable = true  => means run

HW:

mark some test as smoke and regression and run
