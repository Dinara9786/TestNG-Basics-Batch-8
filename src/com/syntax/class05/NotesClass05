TestNG Class 05, January 9, 2020

Maven is built in automation.
POM xml = project object model. ... of maven project. Inside this file we specify configuration properties and
dependancy
Dependancies come from Mavan Repository

Why we need property file = it is a file that have information and data adn stored in teh form of key and value.

We develop utility file that will be reading property file.

We prefer switch because when checks equality, it looks easy and neat.

What is framework?

Improve maintenability of code and reduce code redundancy

is a code organized structure for making code maintenance simpler, and code readability better
rules adn tools fro software (websites) testing.

JAVA = Programming language
Selenium = automates web application
TestNG = testing framework, annotation based tool. it can generate reports, it organizes oru tests, executges tests in paralel mode.
it can automate batch cases.
GIT = version control. With help of GIT we can easily share our codes.
Maven is build automation tool. Maven will help automoate build process from creating structure, wirting codes,
executing and deploying. Will help us automotate these dependancies. Maven will help these dependances.



Framework class 2

Sprint #3
US9890: Admin user should be able to login into HRMS

US8809: System should show error message when invalid login is performed
- empty username and valid password --  username cannot be empty
- valid username and empty password --  password cannot be empty
- valid username and invalid password --  password is invalid

How we implement POM?
using @FindBy annotation and page factory

why we are extending common methods, so that we can easily methods.

PageInitialiser = in this class we initialize all the objects
BaseClass = driver. it is a super class for all of them
CommonMethods = common methods
